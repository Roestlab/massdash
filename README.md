**MassDash** is a powerful platform designed for researchers and analysts in the field of mass spectrometry. By providing a centralized web-based dashboard, MassDash facilitates data analysis and experiment design by enabling users to visualize chromatograms, test algorithms, and optimize parameters. This tool offers a flexible environment for mass spectrometry research, with notable specailty in handling Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) data.

## Installation

**Recommended**: Install the latest stable version of MassDash from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```bash
pip install massdash --upgrade
```

- **Algorithm testing**: Develop and fine-tune custom algorithms by interfacing with MassDash's various data analysis algorithms and workflows.

- **Parameter optimization**: Ensure optimal results for your experiment by optimizing parameters for data analysis workflows, such as *OpenSwathWorkflow*.

- **User-friendly dashboard**: MassDash's dashboard is designed with users in mind, facilitating research productivity in both beginners and experts in the field.

- **Data exploration**: Explore mass spectrometry data with our suite of tools and gain insights to make informed research decisions.

- **Customization**: Flexibly tailor data analysis parameters and results for specific research needs.

- **Rapid prototyping**: Save time and resource when developing mass spectrometry workflows by quickly prototyping and testing research ideas.

- **Data integration**: Seamlessly import, process, and export data to facilitate data sharing and collaboration.

## Launching MassDash from a remote machine

SSH into a remote machine and install `massdash`; it's highly recommended to install `massdash` in a Python virtual environment to contain project-specific dependencies:

```bash
ssh your_user_name@remote_ip_address
```

```bash
pip install massdash
```

Launch MassDash:

```bash
massdash gui
```

Two URLs with an IP address and port number will appear in the terminal after launching MassDash; for example:

```text
  Network URL: http://192.168.142.176:8501
  External URL: http://142.150.84.40:8501
```

 Enter the following command in a local machine's terminal, replacing "----" with the URL port number (e.g., 8501):

```bash
ssh -fNL ----:localhost:---- your_user_name@remote_ip_address
```

You can now view MassDash on the local machine's browser by clicking on either of the provided URLs.

## Docker

MassDash is also available on Docker.

Pull the latest stable version of MassDash from DockerHub:

```bash
docker pull singjust/massdash:latest
```

Spin up the MassDash Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 singjust/massdash:latest
```

**Note:** The MassDash Docker image binds to port 8501 when running MassDash locally.
