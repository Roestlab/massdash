# Unit Tests

Tests are performed using unittest and snapshottest. You will need to have snapshottest installed to run tests, to compare output to previous expected output state.

Install snapshottest with

`pip install snapshottest`

## Running unittests

Execute the following command in test/:

```bash
python -m unittest 
```

For verbose output:

```bash
python -m unittest -v
```
