# TODOs

- [ ] Add peak picking using pyopenms 
- [ ] Add public base conformer model
- [ ] Add gauss smoothing to visualization display. See [plotter.py#L169](https://github.com/Roestlab/massseer/blob/ebae2f529262e5b1a435f23432d1b4c30b7ec456/massseer/plotter.py#L169) and [plotting_ui.py#L52](https://github.com/Roestlab/massseer/blob/ebae2f529262e5b1a435f23432d1b4c30b7ec456/massseer/plotting_ui.py#L52)
- [ ] Generate concensus chrom traces per transition
- [ ] Docker / or just ssh port
- [ ] Make available on PyPi closer to time of publication

# Future TODOs?

- [ ] raw mzML data loading
